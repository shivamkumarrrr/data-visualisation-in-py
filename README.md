# Data Visualization in Python

Welcome to the `data-visualisation-in-py` repository, where complex data becomes clear and actionable insights through the art and science of visualization.

## About This Repository

This repository is a collection of Python scripts and notebooks that demonstrate the use of data visualization libraries to create a variety of charts, graphs, and interactive elements. The goal is to provide clear examples of how to bring data to life, making it easier to understand patterns, trends, and outliers.

## Features

- Examples of basic to advanced visualizations
- Usage of popular Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
- Demonstrations of static, interactive, and animated visualizations
- Best practices for data preparation and visualization
- Tips for customizing and styling charts to improve readability

## Getting Started

To get started with these visualization examples:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, preferably the latest version.
3. Install the required libraries using `pip`:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Navigate through the folders to find different visualization examples.
5. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to see the visualizations in action.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, you should have a basic understanding of:

- Python programming
- Data structures like lists, dictionaries, DataFrames, etc.
- Fundamental concepts of data analysis
